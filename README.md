This project involves building a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten text examples, such as the IAM Handwriting Database, which includes forms of unconstrained handwritten English text. The training process involves tokenizing the text into sequences of characters, encoding them numerically, and using an RNN with LSTM layers to learn patterns in the text. Once trained, the model can generate new, synthetic handwritten-like text by predicting the next character based on a given sequence. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in text generation tasks and highlights the potential of RNNs in learning and recreating sequential data patterns.
